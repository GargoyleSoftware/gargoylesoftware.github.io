# Simplicity in execution. Quality in practice. Abundance in mindset.


Simplicity is hard work.
But, there's a huge payoff.


Our team lives the way we work. We believe values driven decisions will make sure we do right by you and right by us. This is what we’re all about.

### We care, a lot.

No one can ever really be great at something they don’t care about.  Think about the last time you did something you didn’t really care about? How about the last time you did something you did care about? And with people you cared about? That’s an explosive combination. That’s where the magic happens. That is what we cultivate.

### We love the heck out of Clojure

You say drank the kool aid like it’s a bad thing. :wink:
Clojure has reignited our love of programming. It has given us the freedom to create things we are incredibly proud of and have more fun than we’ve ever had before creating them. We are better engineers and thinkers than we ever have been before.

Excuse us, while we nerd out a little, but the macro system gives you unprecedented power and flexibility. And oh man, that interactive REPL? It just speeds everything up. We can’t stop gushing about it

So, we only take Clojure projects then? No.

We take projects we believe in for people and companies and industries we believe in.

That being said, Clojure is our secret weapon.

The tech industry is fast growing and it’s getting more and more crowded and more and more competitive as the days go on. Clojure gives you superior software that is hard to replicate with some of the smartest minds creating it. 
Let us create the perfect fit for you.

### "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## What are we working on right now?

Cannabis. If you’re struggling with scaling your cannabis business, we can help.

### How?

The explosive growth of the cannabis industry is a mixed blessing. With governments creating new regulations every time you turn on the news, maneuvering between all the different levels of government in those regulations, can be a minefield.

Not to mention how to measure growth in such a fast growing industry and what criteria to use in order to measure outcomes and picking the right outcomes to measure in the first place. Quantifying that growth isn’t an easy task.

### We want to make it simple for you.

"Complexity is just simplicity refusing to be anything else.” -Nayyirah Waheed
