# Corporate Values

## Mutualism

Human progress is a dialogue and we actively look for opportunities to participate in it.

Our open source contributions are an obvious way that we do so, but each project we undertake is also an exercise in mutualism. 

By involving our clients as true peers, we honor our duty to arrive at the core of the matter.

## Question Everything

Intellectual inertia can sometimes prevent us from seeing a more direct path.

Through questioning, we can understand the true constraints. Some boulders may be immobile, but others will prove malleable or illusory, opening up new possibilities.

## Adapt to Your Context 

Solutions are very domain-specific. Re-using the same solution out of context rarely leads to optimal results.

"When in Rome" makes all the difference in the world. 

Each project is an opportunity to begin anew, checking old assumptions in the face of new constraints.

## Honor Craftsmanship 

We live in an era of quick and cheap. Mass manufacture and Moore's Law have taught us that nothing is constant but change itself.

Why bother expending the extra effort to get it "right" when you can use an off-the-shelf solution that is "good enough?"

Because, for us, craftsmanship is an art. 

And by relentlessly pushing towards mastery, new patterns reveal themselves, new patterns that can be re-used elsewhere.

## No Attachment 

Throwing away a perfectly good piece of work is painful, but stubbornly clinging to the past is even more harmful.

## Less

It's all too seductive to think that More code, More features, and More hours will solve the problem.

But in pursuing More, maintenance suffers and agility decreases.

What if the problem could be solved with less? 

After all, constraints breed creativity.

## Holism

We could be working jobs in Silicon Valley, but, to us, there's more to life than writing code.

Life must be lived as a whole, and so too must problems be solved as a whole. 

It's easy for technologists to emphasize the importance of technology, but that can narrow lens can obfuscate the Job To Be Done. If 

## Fundamental Value

It's easy to get absorbed in the latest trend, especially when it comes to speculation and the financial markets.

However, while financial value is wildly volatile, fundamental value is much more stable. We aim to pierce through the cloud of financial speculation to glimpse the fundamental value beneath.

## Destinationless Journey

In the West, we love to think of life as a linear journey from A to B.

However, the eventual arrival always pales in comparison with its imagined glory.

Thus, we regain our enthusiasm by embarking on yet another adventure.

Sisyphean? Or joyful? Simply a matter of perspective.
